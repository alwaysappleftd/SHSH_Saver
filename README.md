# SHSH Saver
This is a free tool for saving the onboard SHSH Blobs of A9 to A11 devices. 

The tool supports the iPhone 6s to iPhone X, iPad 5th generation to 7th generation, iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2015), iPad Pro 9.7-inch (2016), iPad Pro 10.5-inch 1st generation and the iPod touch 7th generation.

NOTE: I was not able to successfully upload the SHSH Saver app to this repository because GitHub won't allow files that are over 25MB to be uploaded to repositories.
You can use this link to download the app from MediaFire: https://www.mediafire.com/file/h0bgekgl441530h/SHSH_Saver_v1.0.zip/file

How to use SHSH Saver:

1. Open up the app file in this folder. If you see the warning that says "Unidentified developer", then just simply right-click on the app file and select "Open". Then, the Mac will allow you to override the warning and open the app. 
2. Connect your device to the computer, then enter DFU Mode on your device. If you don't know how, then you can find out how to enter DFU Mode by just Googling "How to Enter DFU Mode on" and then your device model. Example might be "How to Enter DFU Mode on iPhone 8".
3. Click the "Boot Ramdisk" button. You should see a Ramdisk icon on the screen and then some verbose text.
4. Click the "Save Blobs" button. It may take a minute, and then the tool will ask you if you want to choose where to save the blobs. Click the "Yes" button, and choose a Directory or folder on your Mac. 
You should now have a file called "dumped.shsh" in the selected directory!

Enjoy using SHSH Saver!
