# SHSH Saver
This is a free tool for saving the onboard SHSH Blobs of A7 to A11 devices. 

The tool supports the iPhone 5s to iPhone X, iPad 5th generation to 7th generation, iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2015), iPad Pro 9.7-inch (2016), iPad Pro 10.5-inch 1st generation and the iPod touch 6th/7th generation.

NOTE: This is the source code (Xcode project) for SHSH Saver. I have not uploaded the .app file to the Releases section yet. That will be coming soon.
For now, you can use this link to download the app from MediaFire: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/h0bgekgl441530h/SHSH_Saver_v1.0.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/t5cd5kt12no3ahh/SHSH_Saver_v1.2.zip/file)

How to use SHSH Saver:

1. Open up the app file in the folder you downloaded. If you see the warning that says "Unidentified developer", then just simply right-click on the app file and select "Open". Then, the Mac will allow you to override the warning and open the app.
If the app still wonâ€™t open, follow these steps:
  1. Open a blank Terminal window. You can find the Terminal app in the Other folder in your Launchpad.
  2. Type, in lowercase, xattr -cr (without quotes), then drag and drop the Lockra1n application you downloaded into the Terminal window.
  3. Press Enter to run the command.
These steps should allow the app to open. If you encounter any further launching issues, please contact me.

3. Connect your device to the computer, then enter DFU Mode on your device. If you don't know how, then you can find out how to enter DFU Mode by just Googling "How to Enter DFU Mode on" and then your device model. Example might be "How to Enter DFU Mode on iPhone 8".
4. Click the "Boot Ramdisk" button. The tool will ask you to enter your iOS version. This doesn't have to be exact, just a rough guess. Usually putting the .0 of the device's version will work fine, like 14.0 on a 14.7 device. You should see a Ramdisk icon on the screen and then some verbose text.
5. Click the "Save Blobs" button. It may take a minute, and then the tool will ask you if you want to choose where to save the blobs. Click the "Yes" button, and choose a directory or folder on your Mac.
6. After you have selected a directory or folder, the software will ask you if you want to use a custom filename. You can enter any name in the field, or leave it empty for the default, which is "dumped.shsh".
You should now have a file with a custom name or just "dumped.shsh" in the selected directory!

Enjoy using SHSH Saver!
